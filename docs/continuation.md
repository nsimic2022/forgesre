# Session handoff — 26 August 2026

This file is a **session handoff for the next coding agent or contributor**. It is not an operator manual. Operators start at [install and config](install-config.md) and the [operator handbook](operator-handbook.md).

Product on `main` at the end of this session: **V0.7**. Repository: https://github.com/nsimic2022/forgesre.

## 1. Who and when

**Wednesday 26 August 2026.** N asked for Add/Edit **Asset ID first** (typed short id, not derived from hostname) and `./forgesre verify` by **# / id / hostname / IP**.

On the Ubuntu VM N uses, resume with:

```bash
git pull && ./forgesre update
```

(`./forgesre update` already runs `render-monitoring`.) Also: `./forgesre ping`, `./forgesre verify`, `./forgesre test` (appliance health, not inventory). See [docs/llm.md](llm.md).

Hard-refresh the browser after UI/CSS changes (`/static/app.css?v=asset-id-first-1`).

**Never** re-run `./install.sh` on a live box. That regenerates passwords in `secrets/secrets.env` and will wipe the install admin the operator already uses.

---

## 2. Checked twice (pytest)

From this branch, after `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=backend:agents python3 -m pytest tests
PYTHONPATH=backend:agents python3 -m pytest tests
```

Both runs: **310 passed**, 1 warning (Starlette `httpx` / `starlette.testclient` deprecation — ignore), ~40s each. Python 3.12, pytest 9.x.

If pytest fails next session: fix on a `cursor/<name>-05f8` branch, re-run **twice**, then `git merge --no-ff` to `main`. Branch pattern `cursor/<name>-05f8`.

---

## 3. Done today / on main

Add/Edit form order matches the Assets table (skip `#`): **Asset ID**, **Hostname**, **IP**, then the rest. Alarms stays the third column (not rebuilt). Operator types a short unique `asset_id` (`win10-gp`) and a separate hostname (`DESKTOP-CG81N3J`). Edit keeps id immutable. `./forgesre verify` / `ping` accept asset number `#`, id, hostname, and IP. TAB completes numbers, ids, and hostnames.

Do **not** rebuild Alarms or Memory alerts.

---

## 4. What N should do on the VM

Do **not** run `./install.sh`.

```bash
git pull && ./forgesre update
```

Hard-refresh the browser (CSS query `?v=asset-id-first-1`).

---

## 5. Product facts not to redo

These already work on `main`. Do not “fix” them unless N asks.

- `./forgesre test` = appliance health report → `data/reports/`. `./forgesre verify` = live inventory communication.
- Theme toggle cycles **light → dark → system**. Left nav stays dark.
- Dashboard demos are **one** top-right button + a closeable panel. Demo rows stay **labeled DEMO**.
- Incident ids look like `INC-0134_16.08.2026_09:13`.
- RCA is Python under `agents/rca/`. The LLM only rewrites prose. Builtin ForgeRCA always runs first.
- Core is an SMTP **client** only. The UI has no IMAP inbox.
- pytest is a laptop/dev dependency. The Core image must not install it.
- Real Windows scrape is **windows_exporter :9182**, not the lab demo host.
- Prometheus Health Open is **Targets** (`:9090/targets?search=`), not Prometheus process `/metrics`. Core `/metrics` stays.
- Host CLI must not require sqlalchemy/PyYAML. Do not `pip install sqlalchemy` on the Ubuntu host.
- `snmp-exporter` is a **default** compose service.
- Dashboard **HOST DOWN** banner (open exporter/SNMP-down incidents). Do not redo it.
- Backup on the host dumps Postgres via `docker compose exec postgres` with the same docker rights as `./forgesre update` (`docker info`, else `sudo docker compose`). A docker.sock permission error is not “start postgres”.
- One restore unit = one `.tar.gz` inside `backup_<stamp>/`. Do not explode the archive into loose files at `data/backups/` root.
- Host `./forgesre verify` does not import sqlalchemy (`demo_ids.py`).
- Memory bundled alerts exist: `NodeMemoryHigh` / `WindowsMemoryHigh` at **90%**, playrules `node-memory` / `windows-memory`. Do not add load / inodes / blackbox / mysql-redis exporters, a 50-collector dropdown, or a Grafana rewrite unless N asks.
- Add asset: operator types **Asset ID** and **Hostname** separately. Id is immutable after create. Do not derive id from hostname again.

## 6. How to continue next session

1. `git pull origin main`.
2. Read **this file**, then [`docs/llm.md`](llm.md) and [`docs/cli.md`](cli.md).
3. On the VM: `git pull && ./forgesre update`. Never `./install.sh`.
4. `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` if needed, then `PYTHONPATH=backend:agents python3 -m pytest tests` **twice**, then merge to `main`. Branch pattern `cursor/<name>-05f8`.
5. Replies to N are in **Serbian**. OSS docs and code stay in **English**.
6. `ManagePullRequest` `create_pr` often 403. `git merge --no-ff` plus `git push origin main` still lands the change.

---

## 7. Out of scope

Do not start these unless N asks:

- Go / Kubernetes rewrite in [`docs/architecture.md`](architecture.md).
- Zabbix templates, or ticketing as a second Ticket object.
- IMAP inbox in the UI.
- React, Tailwind, Bootstrap, PatternFly npm.
- Fake a live Windows scrape or SNMP walk in the demo panel.
- Explode backup tars into many small files at `data/backups/` root.
- Grafana deep-link on the asset page (N said later).
- Rewriting all of Prometheus `alerts.yml` per asset.
- Load, inodes, blackbox, mysql/redis exporters in compose.
- 50 collectors dropdown on Add asset.

---

## 8. Known leftovers

- Many remote `origin/cursor/*-05f8` branches still exist and are **already merged to `main`**.
- Core slim image may not include `ping`; GUI ICMP then shows that honestly. `./forgesre verify` probes ICMP from the **host** (same as `./forgesre ping`).
- Scheduled `/ops` reports are still plain text.
- Old backups already on the VM as `data/backups/forgesre-*.tar.gz` are still valid; new runs write folders.
- Grafana deep-link from an asset is still later.
- Prometheus global rules may still fire for a host whose ForgeSRE alarm is disabled or raised; ForgeSRE will not open the incident when the webhook carries the value.
