# Session handoff — 7 September 2026

This file is a **session handoff for the next coding agent or contributor**. It is not an operator manual. Operators start at [install and config](install-config.md) and the [operator handbook](operator-handbook.md).

Product on `main` at the end of this session: **V0.7**. Repository: https://github.com/nsimic2022/forgesre.

## 1. Who and when

**Monday 7 September 2026.** Operator N (Serbian) asked to fix a **journal error** related to **“Prometheus Stack”**. There is no user-facing string `Prometheus Stack` / `prometheus_stack` in the tree. The real bug: doctor treated **Grafana** (graphs only, not the alarm path) as a hard FAIL, so System Health looked like the Prometheus monitoring stack was down even when Prometheus `:9090` was up. Failures did not name the hop. Pagination on `main` (`2823c67`) is left alone. Code and docs stay English. Replies to N are Serbian.

On the Ubuntu VM N uses:

```bash
git pull origin main && ./forgesre update
```

**Never** re-run `./install.sh` on a live box. That regenerates passwords in `secrets/secrets.env` and will wipe the install admin the operator already uses.

---

## 2. Checked twice (pytest)

From this branch, after `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=backend:agents python3 -m pytest tests
PYTHONPATH=backend:agents python3 -m pytest tests
```

Pytest count after the double run on `cursor/prometheus-stack-journal-05f8`: fill in after the two runs (was **347** on pagination).

If pytest fails next session: fix on a `cursor/<name>-05f8` branch, re-run **twice**, then `git merge --no-ff` to `main`. Branch pattern `cursor/<name>-05f8`.

---

## 3. Done today / on this branch

Doctor / Journal no longer lie about Prometheus:

- Grafana down → **warn** (yellow), **not** in `failed[]`, **not** overall DEGRADED by itself, **not** a Journal error.
- Alarm path is still **Prometheus → Alertmanager → Core**. Grafana is graphs only.
- Live Core journals `core` / `doctor` **error** only when Prometheus or Alertmanager is actually down. Summary names the hop (`Prometheus :9090`, `Alertmanager :9093`). Never “Prometheus Stack”.
- Healthy Prom+AM does **not** journal error (Grafana warn is ignored). Duplicate identical doctor errors are not re-written. Recovery writes one `ok` after a previous error.
- `_http` `why` includes the probe URL (port is visible).
- Doctor labels: **Prometheus**, **Alertmanager**, **Grafana** (compose ids stay `prometheus` / `alertmanager` / `grafana`).
- Pytest skips live doctor journal (`FORGESRE_DEV=1`). Tests call `journal_doctor_alarm_path` directly.

Did not add Celery, nmap, React, IMAP, sqlalchemy on the host CLI, or restore the LLM catalog. Did not revert pagination.

---

## 4. What N should do on the VM

Do **not** run `./install.sh`.

```bash
git pull origin main && ./forgesre update
```

Then hard-refresh the browser. Check **System Health** and **Journal**: Grafana dark is yellow; Journal error for Prom must show `:9090` or Alertmanager `:9093`.

Lab without image pull: `./forgesre update --offline`.

---

## 5. Product facts not to redo

These already work on `main`. Do not “fix” them unless N asks.

- `./forgesre test` = appliance health report → `data/reports/`. `./forgesre verify` = live inventory communication. `./forgesre ping` = ICMP + exporter. `./forgesre doctor` = System Health lights. Three different commands (`test` / `verify` / `doctor`).
- Theme toggle cycles **light → dark → system**. Left nav stays dark.
- Dashboard demos are **one** top-right button + a closeable panel. Demo rows stay **labeled DEMO**. Demo inject is **admin**.
- Incident ids look like `INC-0134_16.08.2026_09:13`.
- RCA is Python under `agents/rca/`. The LLM only rewrites prose. Builtin ForgeRCA always runs first. LLM payload is compact (5000 chars); stored investigation is full.
- Core is an SMTP **client** only. The UI has no IMAP inbox. One mail outbox: `/ops#mail`.
- pytest is a laptop/dev dependency. The Core image must not install it.
- Real Windows scrape is **windows_exporter :9182**, not the lab demo host.
- Prometheus Health Open is **Targets** (`:9090/targets?search=`), not Prometheus process `/metrics`. Core `/metrics` stays.
- Host CLI must not require sqlalchemy/PyYAML. Do not `pip install sqlalchemy` on the Ubuntu host.
- `snmp-exporter` is a **default** compose service. No SNMP targets → doctor **paused** (yellow), not DOWN.
- Bundled **NetBox** is a **default** compose service (`:8001`). Do not put it behind a profile. `--netbox-url` remains an external override. Image pin is `netboxcommunity/netbox:v4.6.9-5.0.2`. Do not churn NetBox Hub/GHCR tags unless N asks.
- Dashboard **HOST DOWN** banner (open exporter/SNMP-down incidents). Do not redo it. That banner is **not** the Prometheus doctor journal.
- Backup on the host dumps Postgres via `docker compose exec postgres` with the same docker rights as `./forgesre update`.
- One restore unit = one `.tar.gz` inside `backup_<stamp>/`.
- Host `./forgesre verify` does not import sqlalchemy (`demo_ids.py`).
- Memory bundled alerts exist: `NodeMemoryHigh` / `WindowsMemoryHigh` at **90%**, playrules `node-memory` / `windows-memory`. Grafana is not the alarm path. Grafana doctor down is **yellow**, not a Prom FAIL.
- Add asset: operator types **Asset ID** and **Hostname** separately. Id is immutable after create.
- Doctor labels: **Core API** vs **Core (container)**. Core `/api/v1/health` stays a liveness dummy (always-ok). Prom readiness is `/-/ready` on `:9090`.
- The lab SMTP catcher is gone. Do not add one.
- Verify hops: ICMP, PORT, FAMILY, PROM, TARGET, SERIES, AM, CORE, RCA, LLM. Reachability: ping **green** ICMP ok; **yellow** ICMP fail but exporter/SNMP ok; **red** both fail.
- Linux metrics = node_exporter **:9100**. Windows = windows_exporter **:9182**. Network = snmp_exporter :9116.
- Bundled LLM pin = **Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct Q4_K_M** via `./forgesre fetch-llm`. Do **not** restore the GGUF catalog / Health picker.
- `docs/architecture.md` is a **proposal**, not the appliance runtime. **architecture proposal** / **not the V0.7 appliance runtime**.
- GUI ICMP is from the Core container (`iputils-ping` in the Dockerfile). Host `./forgesre ping` stays on the VM.
- Jobs: **one worker thread** in Core. There is no Celery.
- GUI list tables are **10 rows per page** (pagination already on `main`).

Also: `./forgesre ping` and `./forgesre verify` stay distinct from `./forgesre test` / doctor. See [`docs/llm.md`](llm.md).

---

## 6. How to continue next session

1. `git pull origin main`.
2. Read **this file**, then [`docs/llm.md`](llm.md) and [`docs/cli.md`](cli.md).
3. On the VM: `git pull origin main && ./forgesre update`. Never `./install.sh`.
4. `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` if needed, then `PYTHONPATH=backend:agents python3 -m pytest tests` **twice**, then merge to `main`. Branch pattern `cursor/<name>-05f8`.
5. Replies to N are in **Serbian**. OSS docs and code stay in **English**.
6. `ManagePullRequest` `create_pr` often 403. `git merge --no-ff` plus `git push origin main` still lands the change.

---

## 7. Out of scope

Do not start these unless N asks:

- Go / Kubernetes rewrite in [`docs/architecture.md`](architecture.md).
- Zabbix templates, or ticketing as a second Ticket object.
- IMAP inbox in the UI.
- React, Tailwind, Bootstrap, PatternFly npm.
- Fake a live Windows scrape or SNMP walk in the demo panel.
- Explode backup tars into many small files at `data/backups/` root.
- Grafana deep-link on the asset page (N said later).
- Rewriting all of Prometheus `alerts.yml` per asset.
- Load, inodes, blackbox, mysql/redis exporters in compose.
- 50 collectors dropdown on Add asset.
- Celery / Redis job queue / `SKIP LOCKED`.
- A second log stack (host Alloy for every asset).
- NetBox Docker Hub / GHCR tag churn (separate).
- Rewriting discovery as nmap.
- Making Ollama the product default (N will decide later).
- Re-pinning bundled `fetch-llm` to Qwen2.5-1.5B or another GGUF.
- Restoring the llama.cpp GGUF catalog / Health model switcher.
- Raising `timeout_seconds` in `config/forgesre.example.yml` back to 600.
- Reverting GUI list pagination.

---

## 8. Known leftovers

- Many remote `origin/cursor/*-05f8` branches still exist and are **already merged to `main`**.
- Scheduled `/ops` reports are still plain text.
- Old backups already on the VM as `data/backups/forgesre-*.tar.gz` are still valid; new runs write folders.
- Grafana deep-link from an asset is still later.
- Prometheus global rules may still fire for a host whose ForgeSRE alarm is disabled or raised; ForgeSRE will not open the incident when the webhook carries the value.
- Alloy still only ships appliance Core logs as `forge-demo-01`. Real hosts have no Loki until that changes. Limitation: **no host logs shipped**.
- LLM rewrite can still occupy the single job loop for up to `timeout_seconds` (default 90 in example.yml; N’s live yml may be 300) after reports in that pass have already run.
- `config/forgesre.yml` on a live VM is gitignored; a 300s or 600s timeout already written there is not overwritten by `update`.
- Loki/Alloy still FAIL doctor when those containers are dark (not Grafana). Only Grafana was moved to warn.
